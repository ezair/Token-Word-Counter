-   Documentation \[25/30\]
    -   Appropriate level of in-line and header comments
        -   Comments **do not** replicate information better
            communicated by reading the code.
        -   Header comments on files, classes, functions
            -   Document *intention*: what is the purpose of this
                **thing**
            -   Functions: what does it do; what are the parameters and
                their permitted values?
            -   Class/Type: how and where is one constructed; why is one
                made; how long should it live?
        -   In-line comments when necessary to explain/support the code

Need more documentation of how to call the methods. IF you include a
README, please put something into it.

-   Good type, function, and variable names
    -   Descriptive names
    -   Appropriate capitalization
    -   Name length proportional to size of scope: larger scope -&gt;
        longer name

-   Design \[30/30\] -Filter extends abstract class FilterReader
    -   Efficiently overrides read(...) methods

Very nicely done

-   Implementation \[30/30\]
    -   Includes only necessary files
        -   It is clear how to compile the program
        -   It is clear how to run the compiled program
    -   Driver program clearly indicates where to type file name
    -   Comments removed
        -   EOLN comments
            -   At start of line
            -   Alone on line, indented
            -   After code (with and without space)
        -   Delimited comments
            -   Becomes space if in single line
            -   Correct number of lines for multi-line comments
    -   Line numbers match after extraction.
    -   Error messages
        -   No file names
        -   Unable to open file for input
